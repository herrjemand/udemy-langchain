Langchain Udemy
===

This is my code for the Damien Benveniste [Langchain Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-langchain/).

This code is here as great reference in case something does not work, but it worked for me, or was fixed by me while doing the course.

## Additional Notes

- FAISS is failing to install

Lower python version to 3.10. Or creat venv that is 3.10.

- Failing to install "python-poppler" on MacOS?

Install system dependencies:

```bash
brew install pkg-config poppler
```
