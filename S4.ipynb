Each day, 1 dog eats 0.175 scoop of dog food andthe other dog eats 0.125 scoop. Together, how much dog food dothe 2 dogs eat each day?\\nRationale: Ella owns 2 dogs. Each day, 1 dog eats 0.175 scoop of dog food and the other dog eats 0.125 scoop. So, together, the 2 dogs eat (2 x 0.175) + (2 x 0.125) scoops of dog food each day = (0.35) + (0.25) = 0.3 scoops\\nReponse: 0.3\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion: It rained 0.9 inches on Monday. On Tuesday, it rained 0.7 inches lessthan on Monday. How much did it rain on Tuesday?\\nRationale: On Monday it rained 0.9 inches, and on Tuesday it rained 0.7 inches less than on Monday.
