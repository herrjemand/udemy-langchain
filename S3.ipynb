      "page_content='Springer Series in Statistics\\nTrevor Hastie\\nRobert TibshiraniJerome FriedmanSpringer Series in Statistics\\nThe Elements of\\nStatistical Learning\\nData Mining, Inference, and Prediction\\nThe Elements of Statistical LearningDuring the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information tech-\\nnology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biolo-gy, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings butare often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas inthese areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, theemphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberaluse of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interestedin data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning(prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, supportvector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of thistopic in any book.\\nThis major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical\\nmodels, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for thelasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter onmethods for “wide” data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.\\nTrevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at\\nStanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshiranideveloped generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS andinvented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of thevery successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.\\n›springer.comSTATISTICS\\nisbn 978-0-387-84857-0Trevor Hastie • Robert Tibshirani • Jerome Friedman\\nThe Elements of Statictical Learning\\nHastie • Tibshirani • Friedman\\nSecond Edition' metadata={'source': './mixed_data/ESLII_print12_toc (1).pdf', 'page': 0}\n",

      "nology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biolo-gy, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings butare often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas inthese areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, theemphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberaluse of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interestedin data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning(prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, supportvector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of thistopic in any book.\n",
      "This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical\n",
      "models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for thelasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter onmethods for “wide” data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.\n",
      "Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at\n",
      "Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshiranideveloped generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS andinvented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of thevery successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.\n",

      "\"The book \"The Elements of Statistical Learning\" provides a comprehensive overview of the important ideas and concepts in data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. The authors, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman, cover a wide range of topics from supervised to unsupervised learning, including neural networks, support vector machines, and boosting. The second edition of the book includes new topics such as graphical models, random forests, and ensemble methods. The authors are renowned professors of statistics at Stanford University and have made significant contributions to the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "This page is dedicated to the parents and families of the authors, including Valerie and Patrick Hastie, Vera and Sami Tibshirani, and Florence and Harry Friedman.

      "\"vi\" is a text editor commonly used in Unix-like operating systems for editing files.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preface to the second edition of \"The Elements of Statistical Learning\" explains that the popularity of the first edition and the fast pace of research in the field motivated the authors to update the book. They have added four new chapters and made updates to existing chapters while trying to change the layout as little as possible. The preface also clarifies the origin of a quote attributed to William Edwards Deming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second edition of a book on machine learning includes updates and changes to various chapters. The authors address issues with colorblind readers, change the name of a chapter to avoid confusion, and fix a discussion on error-rate estimation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preface to the second edition of a book suggests that chapters 15 and 16 should be read after chapter 10. Chapter 17 only discusses undirected graphical models and does not cover directed graphical models. Chapter 18 explores learning in high-dimensional feature spaces. The authors apologize for errors in the first edition and thank those who provided comments and assistance for the new edition. The book is dedicated to the memory of Anna McPhee.\n",

      "The field of Statistics is facing challenges due to the increasing complexity and size of data. The advent of computers and the information age has led to the emergence of data mining and bioinformatics. Learning from data has become crucial, and computation plays a key role in this revolution. The learning problems can be categorized as either supervised or unsupervised, with the goal being to predict outcomes or describe associations and patterns among input measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book aims to explain important new ideas in learning using a statistical framework. It focuses on the methods and conceptual underpinnings rather than theoretical properties. The authors hope that the book will be useful not just for statisticians, but also for researchers and practitioners in various fields. The authors acknowledge the contributions of many individuals to the completion of the book, and express gratitude to their families and parents for their support. The book emphasizes the impact of statisticians on changing the ways we reason, experiment, and form opinions.\n",

The book covers various topics including an introduction to supervised learning, variable types and terminology, prediction approaches, statistical decision theory, local methods in high dimensions, statistical models, supervised learning, function approximation, and structured regression models.\n",
      "\n",
      "This section discusses different classes of restricted estimators, including roughness penalty and Bayesian methods, kernel methods and local regression, and basis functions and dictionary methods. It also covers model selection and the bias-variance tradeoff. The next section focuses on linear methods for regression, including linear regression models and least squares, subset selection, shrinkage methods such as ridge regression and the lasso, and methods using derived input directions like principal components regression and partial least squares. It also discusses multiple outcome shrinkage and selection, and provides more information on the lasso and related path algorithms. The section concludes with a discussion on computational considerations.\n",

      "The summary includes information about linear methods for classification, such as linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and separating hyperplanes. It also covers basis expansions and regularization techniques, including piecewise polynomials and splines, filtering and feature extraction, smoothing splines, automatic selection of smoothing parameters, nonparametric logistic regression, multidimensional splines, regularization and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and wavelet smoothing. The appendix provides computational considerations for splines and information about B-splines and computations for smoothing splines.\n",

The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings butare often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas inthese areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, theemphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberaluse of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interestedin data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning(prediction) to unsupervised learning.

The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings butare often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas inthese areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, theemphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberaluse of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interestedin data mining in science or industry.
